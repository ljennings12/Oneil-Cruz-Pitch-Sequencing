# Pittsburgh Pirates Application

# This repository contains all materials for my Pittsburgh Pirates Application research. 

# I decided to look into Oneil Cruz's Statcast data. After experimenting with the data, I formed a question: how do pitchers set up Oneil Cruz for a strikeout?

# The first data I delved into was what pitch types Cruz faced the most. Next, I determined what pitch he struck out on the most. Finally, I looked at the pitch sequencing for Cruz broken down by counts and certain at-bats. 

# The files in the repository are an RMarkdown file with the actual code, an HTML file with the output, and the Oneil Cruz Statcast data stored in a CSV file.
