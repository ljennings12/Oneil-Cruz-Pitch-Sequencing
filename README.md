# Oneil Cruz Pitch Sequencing

This repository contains all materials for my Oneil Cruz Pitch Sequencing research. 

I decided to look into Oneil Cruz's Statcast data. After experimenting with the data, I formed a question: how do pitchers set up Oneil Cruz for a strikeout?

The first data I delved into was what pitch types Cruz faced the most. Next, I determined what pitch he struck out on the most. Finally, I looked at the pitch sequencing for Cruz broken down by counts and certain at-bats. 

The files in the repository are an RMarkdown file with the actual code, an HTML file with the output, and the Oneil Cruz Statcast data stored in a CSV file.
